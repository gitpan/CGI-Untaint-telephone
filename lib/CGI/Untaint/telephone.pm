CGI::Untaint::telephone

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # use with CGI::Untaint
  my $untainter = CGI::Untaint->new( $q->Vars );
  $untainter->extract(-as_telephone => 'mobile');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A plugin for CGI::Untaint, this attempts to validate input as looking vaguely
like a telephone number.

Numbers may optionally start with a +, and may contain dots and dashes, which
will be stripped out.

TODO: Ensure that dots and dashes aren't allowed next to each other, and nor
should they be the only content in the number.
